This project contains several subdirectories with useful examples of how system tap can help you while debugging your own device drivers.



Callgraph
---------


Under callgraph a simple timer (that prints a counter) is implemented. Once the driver is compiled (make under the driver path), 

$ cd stap/callgraph/driver/
stap/callgraph/driver$ make

There is only need to execute the debug script, to see the output

stap/callgraph# bash ./debug.sh birria.ko 20
     0 swapper/5(0): -> my_timer_callback
    16 swapper/5(0): <- 0xffffffff810744f6
     0 swapper/5(0): -> my_timer_callback
    18 swapper/5(0): <- 0xffffffff810744f6


Adapt it for your necessities



Printing
--------


Same example as the callgraph one. In this occasion the value of an internal variable to the driver is shown to the user.
The changes just affect to the Systemtap script.
