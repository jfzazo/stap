This project contains several subdirectories with useful examples of how system tap can help you while debugging your own device drivers.



Callgraph
=========

Under callgraph a simple timer (that prints a counter) is implemented. Once the driver is compiled (make under the driver path), 

$ cd stap/callgraph/driver/
stap/callgraph/driver$ make

There is only need to execute the debug script, to see the output

stap/callgraph# bash ./debug.sh birria.ko 20
     0 swapper/5(0): -> my_timer_callback
    16 swapper/5(0): <- 0xffffffff810744f6
     0 swapper/5(0): -> my_timer_callback
    18 swapper/5(0): <- 0xffffffff810744f6
